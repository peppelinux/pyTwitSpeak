Before run it:

    - you must add your Twitter oAuth credential. See TwitterApps help on twitter page to get it.
    - you must install dependencies:

        # easy_install python-daemon
        # easy_install python-twitter



pyTwitSpeak can be run as Daemon or as simple executable with messages in Standard Output.
It also may be run inside python shell:

    <python terminal code>
    
    from pyspeaktwit import *
    
    t = TweetSpeak(**auth_dict)
    
    t.FetchTimeline()
    t.GetLatests()
    t.SayLatests()
    
    </end>



To run it in daemon mode you must configure it inside DAEMON variable in pyspeaktwit.py and execute the program:

    python pyspeaktweet.py

# TODO
# decouple configuration inside another .py file and import it at execution time
# predict language with a collect of words frequency inside twits and make espeak talk with appropriate lang !
# Make logging file for daemon mode ! (important)
